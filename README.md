# Portfolio

## Deployed Page : https://ashlinhanson.github.io/portfolio/

This page was designed with Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML5.

I went with a simple and minimal design for a clean user experience with small personal touches with placeholder images and colors.

This webpage allowed me to become more acquainted with GitHub processes(committing, adding and pushing).
